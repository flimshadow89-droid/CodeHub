## 🔧 Customization

Want to modify the animations? Here's what you can change:

```javascript
// Number of particles
for (let i = 0; i < 500; i++) {  // Change this number

// Particle speed
this.vx = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2;  // Adjust multiplier

// Colors
this.hue = Math.random() * 360;  // HSL color range
```
